# LosslessCut üé• [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/mifi/lossless-cut.svg)]()
Simple, cross platform video editor for lossless trimming / cutting of videos. Great for rough processing of large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. Lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos. It doesn't do any decoding / encoding and is therefore extremely fast and has no quality loss. Also allows for taking JPEG snapshots of the video at the selected time. This app uses the awesome ffmpegüôè for doing the grunt work. ffmpeg is not included and must be installed separately.

## Download


## Installing / running

- Install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- Download [latest LosslessCut from releases](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases)
- Run app
- If ffmpeg is available in <b>$PATH</b>/<b>%PATH%</b> it will just work  
- If not, a dialog will pop up to select ffmpeg executable path.

## Documentation

- Drag drop a video file into player to load or use <kbd>‚åò</kbd>/<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.
- Select the start and end time
- Press the scissors button to export a slice.
- Press the camera button to take a snapshot.

The original video files will not be modified. Instead it creates a lossless export in the same directory as the original file with from/to timestamps. Note that the cut is currently not precise around the cutpoints, so video before/after the nearest keyframe will be lost. EXIF data is preserved.

### Keyboard shortcuts
- <kbd>SPACE</kbd> Play/pause
- <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> Seek backward 1 sec
- <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> Seek forward 1 sec
- <kbd>.</kbd> (period) Tiny seek forward

### Running
```
npm start
```

### Building package

npm run package
```

## TODO / ideas
- About menu
- icon
- Visual feedback on button presses
- ffprobe show keyframes
- ffprobe format
- improve ffmpeg error handling
- Slow scrub with modifier key
- show frame number
- Bundle ffmpeg
- support for loading other formats by streaming through ffmpeg?
- cutting out the commercials in a video file while saving the rest to a single file?
