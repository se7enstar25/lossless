# LosslessCut üé• [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/mifi/lossless-cut.svg)]()

Simple, cross platform video editor for lossless trimming / cutting of videos. Great for rough processing of large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. Lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard GB of data without losing quality. It doesn't do any decoding / encoding and is therefore extremely fast. Also allows for taking JPEG snapshots of the video at the selected time. This app uses the awesome ffmpegüôè for doing the grunt work. Also supports lossless cutting in the most common audio formats.

<b>ffmpeg is now included in the app! üéâ</b>

## Installing / running

- Download [latest LosslessCut from releases](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases)
- Run LosslessCut app/exe
- On OSX, to open LosslessCut.app, Right Click > Open to bypass the security warning.

## Documentation

### Supported platforms
- Mac OS X
- Windows (64/32bit)
- Linux (64/32bit, not tested)

### Supported formats

Since LosslessCut is based on Chromium and uses the HTML5 video player, not all ffmpeg supported formats will be supported.
The following formats/codecs should generally work: MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, OGG, WAV, MP3, AAC, H264, Theora, VP8, VP9
For more information about supported formats / codecs, see https://www.chromium.org/audio-video.

### Typical flow
- Drag drop a video file into player to load or use <kbd>‚åò</kbd>/<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.
- Press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to play/pause
- Select the cut start and end time
- Press the scissors button to export the slice
- Press the camera button to take a snapshot

The original video files will not be modified. Instead it creates a lossless export in the same directory as the original file with from/to timestamps. Note that the cut is currently not precise around the cutpoints, so video before/after the nearest keyframe will be lost. EXIF data is preserved.

### Keyboard shortcuts
