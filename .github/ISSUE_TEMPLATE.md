If you have an issue with cutting a particular file, or an unexpected bug or crash, please open developer tools after starting LosslessCut and before doing the failing operation. Then share the output from the javascript console.

If you have an issue cutting a particular file, please also share the file, if possible. Also please try to cut it with the ffmpeg command line directly.

Also provide the error report if you got one (or `Help`->`Report an error`)

How to open developer tools:
- Any: Tools > Toggle Developer Tools
- Windows: <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>
- Mac: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>
